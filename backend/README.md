## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

First, create a python virtual environment in the root workspace directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv/interview-generator-backend
source .venv/interview-generator-backend/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\interview-generator-backend\Scripts\activate
pip install -r  ./backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend project directory with the following required variables:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY="{Your OpenAI API Key}"
MONGODB_URI_FASTAPI="mongodb+srv://{Your MongoDB Username}:{Your MongoDB Password}@{Your MongoDB Cluster}.mongodb.net"
```

### 3. Run the Application

Run the application by pressing `F5` in VS Code. Ensure that the `.env` file is also in the root of the project directory and that the virtual environment (`venv`) is set to `sa-system-backend`.

or using:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at [**Swagger UI**](http://localhost:8000/docs)
